title: Pickle App

###We built a transit recommendation app called [Pickle](http://www.citypickle.com).

>We are inspired by people close to us, family friends colleagues , people who love NYC, urban explorers both new and old looking for the best way to get to their destinations. We have sat in lunches, coffee breaks discussing passionately the 'best' way of getting to the beach, the mountain, the restaurant and gallery. We decided to make this app for the urban explorer faced with this 'pickle'.

We are proud of creating pickle, the first app to take into account environmental context such as cost, traffic , hyper local weather, distance and transportation delays to give the user the best transportation recommendation. We crafted an algorithm that analyzes and rates each available urban transportation option based on these factors and presents them in order of preference giving our urban explorer the best and most efficient route possible.

For example if you wish to get from Columbus circle to the MoMa and the weather is beautiful, Pickle happily chirps that you walk however if weather turns sour, taxi is a much better option.

We want the future to be smarter and Pickle is our submission toward this.
